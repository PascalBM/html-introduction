<h3>A funny story</h3>
In my first year in high school I used to make weird noises in the classroom. Everyone was laughing because of the weird noise.
The teacher couldn't guess where the noise came from. At the end she caught me, I ended up giving my agenda.
It wasn't meant to make the teacher angry.

<h4>TL;DR</h4>
<p>I was one of the jokers in my early years of high school. <br/> </p>
